# Title
  “Detecting bone and cartilage injuries through knee joint MRI images with the use of Machine Learning”
## Team members
  Graham Ragland (geragland), Rahul Appaji (rappaji)
## Project decription
  - Goal: To create a program that uses machine learning in order to determine the type of bone and cartilage disease/injuries that are seen on a MRI image of a knee joint. Examples of conditions that our program will diangose are ACL tears and meniscus tears. 
  - Dataset we plan to use:A set of MRI images of the knee joint that showcase a variety of different conditions along that are associated with different labels such as "ACL tear", "meniscus tear", and "normal".
