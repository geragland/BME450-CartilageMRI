## Project description
  - Goal: Determine the type of ACL or cartilage injury that are seen on a MRI image of a knee joint. Examples of conditions that our program will diangose are ACL tears and meniscus tears. 
  - Dataset we plan to use: A set of MRI images from the Stanford University Medical Center called MRNet of the knee joint that showcase a variety of conditions that are associated with labels such as "ACL tear", "meniscus tear", and "normal". We will commit a part of this dataset as our training set (60-80%), development set (10-20%), and our testing set (10-20%).
  - Overall description: For our final project, our team will create a machine learning program with the aid of PyTorch that would be able to determine the condition/injury that a MRI image is showcasing. The program would function by being inputted an MRI image of a knee joint and then outputting its determination of which injury is being shown or if the image is showing a normal knee joint.
